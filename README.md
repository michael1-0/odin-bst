This is a project submission for The Odin Project: Binary Search Tree, where I was tasked to implement a binary search tree along with its methods like inserting, traversals, deletion, etc. 

To run this project, simply use `node` (comes with Node) command along with an argument passed in that is the index: `node index.js`, a driver code will run, showcasing an example of a tree on the console.
